  <h3>Registration Information
  </h3>
   <hr>

   <p> If you plan to attend just URiCA or both URiCA and KUMUNU, <a
   href="https://forms.gle/YZGFgLsLQ7hK9T5s6"> please register
   here,</a> and indicate which conferences you plan to attend. Once
   you've completed that registration form you do not need to also
   complete the KUMUNU registration form. The only graduate students
   that need to complete KUMUNU registration are the graduate students
   that will be attending KUMUNU and will <em>not</em> be attending URiCA.</p> 

 <p>There is a block of hotel rooms reserved for those who register by <b>April
  10th</b>. Do not call the hotel to make your room reservation as we
  will be providing a rooming list to the hotel directly. We will be able to provide mileage reimbursement for those
  traveling by car. For support with airfare, please email one of the
  <a href="URiCA.html#Organizers">organizers</a>. We may still be able to reimburse some lodging or travel if you
  need to register after the deadline.</p>
