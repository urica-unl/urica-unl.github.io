      <u><em>Title:</u></em> Generic Lines in Projective Space and the Koszul Property
      <br> <br>
      <u><em>Abstract:</u></em> A standard graded \(\mathbb C\)-algebra is said to be Koszul if the minimal graded \(\mathbb C\)-resolution \(\mathbf F\)
      is linear; by linear, we mean in every differential matrix of \(\mathbf F\) every entry is a linear form. The definition of a Koszul algebra seems restrictive,
      but as it turns out, Koszulalgebras possess remarkable numerical and homological properties and are ubiquitous in commutative algebra. Thus, it is an interesting
      question to determine families of rings that will admit the Koszul property. <br>
      In this talk, we will briefly summarize some classical examples of Kodzul algebra and discuss numerical invariants of the coordinate ring \(R\) of a generic set
      of \(m\) lines in \(\mathbb P^n\). We also show that \(R\) is \(G\)-quadratic if \(2m \leq n+1\) and \(R\) is Koszul if \(m\) is even and \(m+1 \leq n\) or \(m\)
      is odd and \(m+2\leq n\). Lastly, we show that if the following inequality holds, then \(R\) is not Koszul.
      \[m \geq \frac{1}{72}\left( 3(n^2 + 10n+13) + \sqrt{3(n-1)^3(3n+5)} \right)\]

      <u><em>Title:</u></em> Symmetric Group Fixed Quotients of Polynomial Rings
      <br> <br>
      <u><em>Abstract:</u></em> Let the symmetric group act on the polynomial ring \(S = k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]\)via variable permutation. We consider the quotient 
      module \(M\) which sets a monomial equal to all of its images under the action. This is a module over the ring of invariants, with relatively little known 
      about its structure. When using integer coefficients, we can embed \(M\) as an ideal inside the ring of symmetric polynomials. Doing so gives rise to a family 
      of ideals - one for each \(n\). Localizing the coefficient ring of \(S\) at a prime \(p\) reveals striking behavior in these ideals, which stay stable 
      (in a sense) as \(n\) grows, but jump in complexity each time \(n\) equals a multiple of \(p\). In this talk, we will discuss the construction of this family of 
      ideals, as well as some results and conjectures on its structure.

      <u><em>Title:</u></em> Rees algebras, differential operators, and group actions: Computing some Ext and local cohomology modules of powers of the ideal of maximal minors
      <br> <br>
      <u><em>Abstract:</u></em> Let \(R\) be the ring of polynomial functions in \(mn\) variables with coefficients in \(\mathbb{C}\), where \(m>n\). Set \(X\) to be 
      the matrix in these variables and \(I\) to be the ideal of maximal minors of this matrix. I will discuss the \(R\)-module structure of certain Ext and local 
      cohomology modules arising from the rings \(R/I^t\). In particular, I will focus on the case where \(X\) is size \(n \times (n-1)\), where a grab bag of 
      techniques from Rees algebras, the \(\mathcal{D}\)-module structure of local cohomology, and the GL-invariant nature of \(I\) can be used to compute the 
      previously mentioned modules.

      <u><em>Title:</em></u> On the Equations of Rees Algebras
      <br> <br>
      <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> 
    One of the classical problems within algebraic geometry is to determine the implicit equations defining the closed image and the graph of 
    a rational map between projective spaces. Algebraically, this corresponds to determining the defining equations of the Rees algebra of the ideal whose generators 
    define such a map. In this talk, we will discuss the history of the problem, including some recent developments. In particular, we will discuss how classical 
    techniques can be updated to approach the problem in different settings, and possible future directions.

      <u><em>Title:</em></u> The Non-Lefschetz Locus of the First Cohomology Module of a Locally Free Sheaf \(\mathcal E\) of Rank \(2\) over \(\mathbb P^2\)
      <br> <br>
      <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> A finite length graded \(R-\)module \(M\) has the Weak Lefschetz Property if there is a linear element \(l\) in \(R\) such that the 
      multiplication map \((\times l)\)  from \(M_i\) to \(M_{i+1}\) has maximal rank. The set of linear forms with this property forms a Zariski-open set and its 
      complement is called the non-Lefschetz locus. In this presentation, I will focus I focus on the study of the non-Lefschetz locus for the first cohomology module 
      of a locally free sheaf \(\mathcal E\) of rank \(2\) over \(\mathbb P^2\). The main result is that this non-Lefschetz locus has the expected codimension under 
      the assumption that \(\mathcal E\) is general.

       <u><em>Title:</em></u> New Perspectives on Geproci-ness
       <br> <br>
       <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> The geproci property is a recent development in the world of geometry. We define the notion of the geproci set and discuss new 
       developments in the characterization of the geproci property. These developments come from analyzing configurations of points in new settings, such as in 
       positive characteristic and in the non-reduced setting. These developments come with exciting new connections to combinatorics and group theory. Finally, 
       we will discuss natural next questions these developments can lead to, especially with regard to investigating the combinatorial connection.
